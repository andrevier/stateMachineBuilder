To-do:
1) Preset the data for the state machine in the model workspace of the 
'testModel.xls'. (x)

2) Divide the eventsTable variable in the input of the StateMachine class
 as eventsArray and activeEvents. Simulink doesn't support table.
- Inputs for a StateMachine class:
      events (array nx1);
      disabledEventsInEachStates (struct);
      transitions (nx3).

3) Consider change the cell switchedOffEvents into several arrays of 
different values. Seems that simulink doens't support cell arrays as input.
Struct seems good for it.
