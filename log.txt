To-do:
1) Preset the data for the state machine in the model workspace of the 
'testModel.xls'. (x)

2) Change the input for StateMachine class.

The StateMachine class required table variable as input argument, but 
Simulink doesn't accept this type as input for the Matlab function block. 
Therefore, the StateMachine class now accepts: 
events (array nx1);
disabledEventsInEachStates (cell array);
transitions (array nx3);

3) Change the input for StateMachine class.

Create a repository to these changes: changeStateMachine.

The StateMachine class required cell array as input argument, but 
Simulink doesn't accept this type as input for the 'Matlab function block'. 
Therefore, the StateMachine class is changed to accept in the contructor: 
list of states (nx1 State array);
transitions (array nx3);

x 1) Update StateMachineUtils and tests.

This class has the purpose to read data from auto-generated files or user 
made files and transform it into arguments to initialize StateMachine class.
Then, it has to create:
- list of States class objects;
- transitions array;
- events array.

2) Create a unique read method for the documents.
Their name is like loadSomethingFrom(path, format);

x 3) getter and setter methods must be changed:

1) Create and test a class to encode the array of State object into the 
Simulink block.

2) Create a test class to the new class.

26/06/23
Change the input arguments of StateMachine from an array of State objects 
to a cell of State object because an array of objects is not supported for  
code generation in Simulink block.
