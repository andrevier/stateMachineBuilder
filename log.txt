To-do:
1) Preset the data for the state machine in the model workspace of the 
'testModel.xls'. (x)

2) Change the input for StateMachine class.

The StateMachine class required table variable as input argument, but 
Simulink doesn't accept this type as input for the Matlab function block. 
Therefore, the StateMachine class now accepts: 
events (array nx1);
disabledEventsInEachStates (cell array);
transitions (array nx3);

3) Change the input for StateMachine class.

Create a repository to these changes: changeStateMachine.

The StateMachine class required cell array as input argument, but 
Simulink doesn't accept this type as input for the 'Matlab function block'. 
Therefore, the StateMachine class is changed to accept in the contructor: 
list of states (nx1 State array);
transitions (array nx3);

-> 1) Update StateMachineUtils and tests.

This class has the purpose to read data from auto-generated files or user 
made files and transform it into arguments to initialize StateMachine class.
Then, it has to create:
- list of States class objects;
- transitions array;
- events array.

2) Create a unique read method for the documents.
Their name is like loadSomethingFrom(path, format);

-> 3) getter and setter methods must be changed:

commit --
* Change the get and set methods' names in the StateMachineUtils from 
getProperty() or setProperty() to get.property or set.property. According 
to sintaxes as in:
https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_oop/property-set-methods.html

* Access them by calling the property name: obj.property.

* Review of the TestStateMachineUtils: Fix the names of get and set methods;
add the property numberOfStates to easily access the number of states 
loaded.

* Review the TestStateMachine: Fix names of get and set methods and property 
classes.

* Test the StateMachine class to read files and correctly create input 
argument for the class.
