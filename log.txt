To-do:
1) Preset the data for the state machine in the model workspace of the 
'testModel.xls'. (x)

2) Change the input for StateMachine class.

The StateMachine class required table variable as input argument, but 
Simulink doesn't accept this type as input for the Matlab function block. 
Therefore, the StateMachine class now accepts: 
events (array nx1);
disabledEventsInEachStates (cell array);
transitions (array nx3);

3) Change the input for StateMachine class.

The StateMachine class required cell array as input argument, but 
Simulink doesn't accept this type as input for the Matlab function block. 
Therefore, the StateMachine class now accepts: 
list of states (nx1 State array);
transitions (array nx3);
